algorithm
==================


`Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org>`_ is a Python web framework and
asynchronous networking library, originally developed at `FriendFeed
<http://friendfeed.com>`_.  By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado
can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for
`long polling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_Polling>`_,
`WebSockets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>`_, and other
applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.
